VNDK Header Checker
===================

The VNDK header checker consists of 3 tools:
[header-abi-dumper](#Header-ABI-Dumper),
[header-abi-linker](#Header-ABI-Linker), and
[header-abi-diff](#Header-ABI-Diff).  The first two commands generate ABI dumps
for shared libraries.  The third command compares the ABI dumps with the
reference ABI dumps in [prebuilts/abi-dumps].  If there are no ABI dumps under
[prebuilts/abi-dumps], follow the instructions in
[Create Reference ABI Dumps](#Create-Reference-ABI-Dumps) to create one.

## Header ABI Dumper

`header-abi-dumper` dumps the ABIs (including classes, functions, variables,
etc) defined in a C/C++ source file.

The `-I` command line option controls the scope of ABIs that must be dumped.
If `-I <path-to-export-include-dir>` is specified, the generated ABI dump will
only include the classes, the functions, and the variables that are defined in
the header files under the exported include directories.

### Usage

```
header-abi-dumper -o <dump-file> <source_file> \
    -I <export-include-dir-1> \
    -I <export-include-dir-2> \
    ... \
    -- \
    <cflags>
```

For more command line options, run `header-abi-dumper --help`.


## Header ABI Linker

`header-abi-linker` links several ABI dumps produced by `header-abi-dumper`.
This tool combines all the ABI information present in the input ABI dump files
and prunes the irrelevant ABI dumps.

### Usage

```
header-abi-linker -o <linked-abi-dump> \
    <abi-dump1> <abi-dump2> <abi-dump3> ... \
    -so <path to so file> \
    -v <path to version script>
```

For more command line options, run `header-abi-linker --help`.


## Header ABI Diff

`header-abi-diff` compares two header ABI dumps produced by
`header-abi-dumper`.  It produces a report outlining all the differences
between the ABIs exposed by the two dumps.

### Usage

```
header-abi-diff -old <old-abi-dump> -new <new-abi-dump> -o <report>
```

For more command line options, run `header-abi-diff --help`.

### Return Value

* `0`: Compatible
* `1`: Changes to APIs unreferenced by symbols in the `.dynsym` table
* `4`: Compatible extension
* `8`: Incompatible
* `16`: ELF incompatible (Some symbols in the `.dynsym` table, not exported by
  public headers, were removed.)

### Configuration
header-abi-diff reads a config file named `config.json`. The config file must
be placed in the dump directory, such as
`prebuilts/abi-dumps/platform/33/64/x86_64/source-based/config.json`.
The file consists of multiple sections. There are two types of config sections:
global config section and library config section. Each library config section
contains flags for a specific version and a library. header-abi-diff chooses
the library config section by options `-target-version` and `-lib`.
header-abi-diff applies cli flags first, then the global config section and
library config section.

#### Target version
The Soong Build System performs Cross-Version ABI Check on NDK and platform
libraries to ensure their compatibility across versions. For example, when the
future SDK version of current source is 34, the source ABI dump would be diffed
with version 33 dump to check the backward compatibility. In this case, the
`-target-version 34` is passed to header-abi-diff to select the corresponding
config section.

#### Linker Set Keys
In some cases, it is necessary to skip the ABI check for specific types and
functions. In the ABI dumps, every class, union, enum, and function has a
unique linker set key. The cli option `-ignore-linker-set-key` and the key
`ignore_linker_set_keys` in the config section specify the types and
functions that should be skipped. The linker set key can be found in the
generated .abidiff file and the .lsdump file.

#### Format
Here is an example of a config.json.
```json
{
  "global": {
    "flags": {
      "allow_adding_removing_weak_symbols": true,
    },
  },
  "libfoo": [
    {
      "target_version": "current",
      "flags": {
        "check_all_apis": true,
      },
    },
    {
      "target_version": "34",
      "ignore_linker_set_keys": [
        "_ZTI14internal_state",
      ],
      "flags": {
        "allow_extensions": true,
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Library Config Section
A library config section includes members: "target_version",
"ignore_linker_set_keys" and "flags". header-abi-diff selects the config
section that matches the target version given by cli.
Take above config as an example, if `-target-version 34` and `-lib libfoo` are
specified, the selected config section is:
```json
{
  "target_version": "34",
  "ignore_linker_set_keys": [
    "_ZTI14internal_state",
  ],
  "flags": {
    "allow_extensions": true,
  }
}
```

## Create Reference ABI Dumps

`utils/create_reference_dumps.py` may be used to create reference ABI dumps.

#For VNDK libraries

For example, the command below creates reference ABI dumps for all VNDK shared
libraries on arm, arm64, x86, and x86_64 architectures:

```
$ python3 create_reference_dumps.py
```

To create reference ABI dumps for a specific library, run the command below:

```
$ python3 create_reference_dumps.py -l libfoo
```

This will create reference dumps for `libfoo`, assuming `libfoo` is a VNDK
library.

# For LLNDK libraries

```
$ python3 create_reference_dumps.py -l libfoo --llndk
```
This will create reference dumps for `libfoo`, assuming `libfoo` is an LLNDK
library.


For more command line options, run `utils/create_reference_dumps.py --help`.
